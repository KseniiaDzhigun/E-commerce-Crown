## Technologies
This project is gradually improved using more advanced topics, e.g., this was initially built with Context API. Then it was migrated over to Redux-Saga. This project was also initially written using Javascript, sass. Then it was updated with CSSinJS and Typescript. It might look simple but it is made following the best coding practices and keeping in mind scalability.
